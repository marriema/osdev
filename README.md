# simpleos
A toy operating system based on <a href = "http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm"> Brans' Kernel Development Tutorial</a>  
In the near future, I will work on the following functionality  
 - Multi-process/Multi-threading/Spinlock/Basic round robin scheduling algorithm
 - Support elf(now support flat binary program)
 - Write the 17 sys call necessary for porting c library (fork, exec, exit, open …..)
 - Port newlib
 - Start writing user space apps like env, rm, mkdir… etc
 - I can’t wait to start coding GUI, but still need more time to build these basic infrastructure in order for a functional gui

# How to run and test simpleos kernel

## Ubuntu(recommended, not required)
For OS X users, please use Vagrant to setup a virtual ubuntu environment first  
<a href = "https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html"> Download Vagrant here</a>

Be sure to install virtual box and ruby first.  

A vagrant file is provided here:  
```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty32"
  config.ssh.forward_x11 = true
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end
end
```
Create a file named Vagrantfile in any directory you like, then simply do
```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

## Preparation
Simpleos use elf-i686-gcc as cross-compiler, please build the cross compiler on your system first.

<a href = "http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler">How to build a cross compiler</a>  
Or, a rewritten/translated version of the above wiki article in Simplified Chinese  

Link: <a href = "http://pan.baidu.com/s/1hsg6AEg">环境搭建与交叉编译器</a> Download password: 7ksb  

Then, install nasm 
```
sudo apt-get install nasm
```

Now clone the repo to your vm and simply run ./compile.sh to compile the kernel, and then choose one of the following simulator to boot simpleos. QEMU is more recommended.

## QEMU
1.  Run sudo apt-get install qemu-system
2.  Run ./qemu_run.sh to boot simpleos


### Debug with QEMU
1. run ./debug_qemu.sh

## Bochs
1.  sudo apt-get install bochs
2.  sudo apt-get install bochs-x
3.  sudo apt-get install bochs-sdl
4.  If you have problems with bochs-x(which in my case it is), add a line "display_library: sdl" in bochsrc.txt, if you're using my bochsrc.txt, just ignore this step
5.  run ./update_image.sh to poke your kernel binary into the floppy image file
6.  run ./run_bochs to boot simpleos
